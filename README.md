## 1. Selected Case Study: NovaMart Retail Logistics & Storefront

### 1.1 Business Context & Overview
**NovaMart** is a fast-growing omni-channel e-commerce retail enterprise operating across West Africa. The platform connects consumers with consumer electronics, groceries, fashion, and household appliances. NovaMart manages a high volume of transactions, fluctuating inventory levels, high-concurrency order placement, and multi-hub logistics.

### 1.2 Database Users
* **Shoppers/Customers:** Search for products, view dynamic pricing, place orders, make digital payments, and track order fulfillment.
* **Merchants/Suppliers:** Manage catalog inventory, update stock counts, and view sales metrics.
* **Warehouse & Logistics Operators:** Pick, pack, dispatch orders, and update delivery status timestamps.
* **Customer Support & Finance:** Process refunds, verify payments, audit ledger balances, and resolve disputes.
* **Database Administrator (DBA):** Monitor system performance, optimize query plans, manage replication, and ensure data integrity under high traffic.

### 1.3 Major Data Stored
1. **User & Identity Data:** Customer profiles, hashed credentials, billing/shipping addresses, contact details.
2. **Product Catalog:** Categories, brands, products, SKUs, inventory counts, pricing tiers, and dynamic product attributes.
3. **Transactional Orders:** Order headers, line items (`order_items`), unit prices, discount tokens, order statuses.
4. **Financial Payments:** Payment gateways, transaction reference tokens, payment methods, transaction amounts, status timestamps.
5. **NoSQL / Semi-Structured Data:** Product reviews, clickstream session telemetry, and flexible polymorphic product specifications.

### 1.4 Key Database Operations Supported
* High-speed catalog browsing and faceted filtering across categories and price ranges.
* Atomic order placement and stock deduction with ACID guarantees.
* Safe concurrent checkout handling (preventing overselling when inventory is scarce).
* Analytical reporting: top-selling products, category revenue, customer lifetime value.
* Hybrid storage: Relational RDBMS for financial/inventory integrity, NoSQL Document Store for dynamic catalog attributes.

## 3. Quick Start & Test Verification Cheat Sheet

### 3.1 One-Command Master Test Suite
To automatically verify all 5 portfolio modules and artifacts at once:
```powershell
# In PowerShell:
.\verify_all_portfolios.ps1

# Or in Windows CMD / Double-Click:
verify_all_portfolios.bat
```

### 3.2 Individual Activity Test Scripts
Each portfolio activity includes standalone verification scripts that can be directly executed against MySQL, MongoDB, or Docker:

| Portfolio | Primary Deliverable | One-Command Verification Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Portfolio 1** | Relational DDL & Integrity Views | `mysql -u root < portfolio-1-database-design/verify_constraints.sql` |
| **Portfolio 2** | Query Optimization & Indexing | `mysql -u root < portfolio-2-query-optimisation/benchmark_optimization.sql` |
| **Portfolio 3** | ACID Transactions & Concurrency | `mysql -u root < portfolio-3-transactions-concurrency/deadlock_simulation.sql` |
| **Portfolio 4** | Document NoSQL & In-Memory Redis | `python portfolio-4-nosql/run_nosql_demo.py` |
| **Portfolio 5** | Distributed GTID Cluster & Replicas | `docker exec -i novamart-mysql-replica mysql -u root -pRootPassword2026! < portfolio-5-distributed-cloud/verify_replication_health.sql` |

## 5. Academic Integrity & AI Use Declaration
This practical portfolio represents independent work designed and verified by **Peace Ekoh (ID: 301866431)**. 
Where artificial intelligence tools were used as learning aids:
1. **Tool Used:** Google DeepMind / Antigravity AI Assistant.
2. **Usage Scope:** Brainstorming edge-case queries, schema formatting, and reviewing query execution plan syntax.
3. **Student Verification:** Every SQL schema, index, query, transaction, and NoSQL script was executed and validated locally on MySQL 8.0.30, with execution outputs and logs personally captured and confirmed.
